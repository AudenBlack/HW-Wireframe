            <p>Hello world, fancy meeting you here on my very first webpage! Lets see, what can I say about myself? I am a Jamaican native, but moved to the United States when I was three years old. Since then, I have been very hopeful that my future here will be a bright one. When I first arrived, Stamford Connecticut was where my family and I made our home. We later moved to Flordia when I was eight years old. I eventually became a student at Freedom High School in 2010 and later went on to be a student at Valencia College. During that time I had my beautiful baby girl Auria who I now had to provide for. Sadly, school had to be put on hold due to the strain put on me at such a young age. So then, here I am once again, striving to complete the UCF Coding Bootcamp Program and have a chance at attaining my dreams to be able to work with computers through coding and design and possibly become a game designer in the near future. </p>
